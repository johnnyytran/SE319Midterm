            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>This proposal aims to develop a comprehensive technology catalog to address the challenges users face in navigating the vast and ever-expanding realm of technological products. The current issue lies in the lack of a centralized resource offering detailed information about various devices and innovations, leading to difficulty for users in making informed decisions. Our project aims to solve this problem by creating a user-friendly platform that consolidates comprehensive details, specifications, and reviews for a diverse range of technologies. This catalog will empower individuals to make well-informed choices tailored to their specific needs and preferences, offering a streamlined and accessible solution in the dynamic landscape of today's technology market.</p>

            <p>My name is Johnny Tran, and I am currently a senior, studying computer engineering at Iowa State University. My academic background includes relevant coursework such as Com S 227, Com S 228, Com S 309, and CPRE 329, which has provided me with a strong foundation in skills necessary for the successful development and management of this project. Growing up, technology has always been an interest of mine. As we live in a world where technology has become a huge part of our daily lives, I am motivated to create a platform that enables individuals to seamlessly acquire the latest technological innovations. Using my prior knowledge of software development and management, I am excited to embark on this project to assist people in acquiring technology tailored to their specific needs.</p>
            <p>Hello, I'm Ethan Duong, a junior studying software engineering at Iowa State University. My journey in software engineering has been improved by courses like COM 227, COM S 228, and SE 185, which have equipped me with a solid foundation in programming. Beyond the classroom, I've delved into personal projects, including developing a full-stack personal finance tracker. Using tools like React, Node.js, and MongoDB, this hands-on experience familiarized me with the complexities of front-end and back-end development. I'm eager to leverage my prior programming and web design knowledge to start this project to create a robust web application that could meet the needs of future users.
